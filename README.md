## Master Workforce Research Internship Summmer 2023 ## 


Catch Phish is an online platform to learn about Phishing emails and how to protect yourself against them. This website was built as part of our submodel "Phish Training" for the Master Workforce Research Internship by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, Bayamon campus and the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, San German campus as part of our Modeling and Simulation research program. This project hopes to help people learn how to identify Phishing emails and prevent falling into the trap of bad actors.
